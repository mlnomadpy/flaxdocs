# Welcome to Flax Training Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for training neural networks with **Flax**! This documentation is designed to help you get started with Flax and master advanced training techniques.

## What is Flax?

Flax is a high-performance neural network library built on top of JAX. It provides:

- **Functional API**: Pure functional approach to building neural networks
- **Performance**: Leverages JAX's JIT compilation and automatic differentiation
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize and extend for research
- **Scalability**: Built-in support for distributed training

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into three main sections:

### 🚀 Basics

Learn the fundamentals of training models with Flax:
- Setting up your environment
- Creating your first model
- Training loops and optimization
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model checkpointing and evaluation

[Get Started with Basics →](/docs/basics/getting-started)

### 📈 Scale

Scale your models to production:
- Distributed training across multiple devices
- Data parallelism and model parallelism
- Performance optimization techniques
- Large batch training strategies
- Multi-host training setups

[Learn about Scaling →](/docs/scale/distributed-training)

### 🔬 Research

Advanced techniques for research:
- Custom training loops
- Mixed precision training
- Advanced optimization strategies
- Experiment tracking and reproducibility
- State-of-the-art architectures
